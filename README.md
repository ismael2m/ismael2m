## Yo there ✌🏾

Hi everyone ! I'm Ismaël Mmadi, __Javascript web developer__ based in __Paris__.  

Basically, I'm more front-end oriented. I use <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React JS</a> as JS library to code my front/client-side projects. When i wanted to create more complexe projects (with databases etc...), I went to other side and i started to use <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node JS</a>, <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a> and <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">Mongo DB</a>. Now, I use the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack" target="_blank">MERN Stack</a> and Next.JS to build my new full stack side projects. 

I love the design🖌️ too (Graphic design, web design). I regulary use Figma, Photoshop and Illustrator to design my projects.
